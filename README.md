# Personal Introduction

I am an ambitious and hardworking individual with a passion for all things digital. Having recently completed a course in Full Stack Web Development and exploring all aspects involved, and with my professional background experience in digital Marketing and Communications, I am looking to pursue a career in UX/UI Design. I have a keen eye for detail and excellent communication skills when either working within a team or liaising with clients. I have an independent ability to handle tasks with a methodical approach and ensure projects are completed to the highest standard and in the required time frame. For any knowledge I may initially lack, I make up for in ensuring to learn fast and with complete understanding.

# Education


### Code Institute - 2020 - 2021
Diploma in Software Development

2:1 - Second Class Honours

After graduating University, I started Digital Marketing roles working closely with external Web 
Developers and took great interest in the different coding languages, along with the initial process from UX/UI design to website production. Realising this was a keen interest of mine, I enrolled into a Full Stack Web Development Diploma course at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net).  They are the UK's only credit- rated coding bootcamp, credited by University of the West of Scotland (USW). The course took a year to complete and enabled me to develop skills in main coding languages HMTL, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Django. 

Along with main coding languages, the course also expanded on frameworks such as Bootstrap and Materialize, Application Program Interfaces (API's), jQuery, database programs such as MongoDB 
Atlas and relational database MySQL, deployment through GitHub pages (switching to PostgreSQL where applicable) and Heroku, Stripe payment system and Amazon Web Services. 

I completed four milestone projects with Code Institute which were all built through GitHub using 
Gitpod. I used version control through Git to modify the repositories to produce a step by step log
during development. Before starting the milestone development, I started with UX design by mapping out the 5 planes method of user experience and essentially created a business plan of customer and company objectives and requirements. I created wireframes for each project through using either 
Adobe Creative Suit programs or Balsamiq which assisted in the website development structure. 

Modules studied in this course:
* HTML Fundamentals
* CSS Fundamentals
* User-Centric Frontend Development
* JavaScript Fundamentals
* Interactive Frontend Development
